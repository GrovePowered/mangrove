## mangrove
Derivative of [mache](https://github.com/PaperMC/mache/tree/) that provides patches compatible
with Grove's build tooling.

### Goal
Mangrove is a project that provides fully compatible base patches for the vanilla
minecraft server. This serves as the base for the Grove Minecraft server project. Of course,
anyone can use this for their own purposes as well.

### License
All patches under this license are in [LGPL-3.0-only](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html), in the hopes
that they will be useful. All the patches' base code belongs to Mojang, and are not part of the licensed work.
